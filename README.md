# TNDS-exercises
some selected exercises carried out during the course of numerical treatment of experimental data (TNDS) at the physics faculty of Unimi. 
- [classes_and_inheritance](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/classes_and_inheritance): In these exercises I solved a simple electrostatics problem, in particular I calculated the electric field generated by a dipole.
By performing this exercise, I deepened the concept of inheritance in C ++;
- [zeros_of_a_function](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/zeros_of_a_function): In these exercises I have faced the problem of finding the zeros of a function. To do this I created two abstract classes to represent respectively a generic function of a variable, and a generic method for searching for zero;
- [numerical_integration](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/numerical_integration): In these exercises I have implemented some algorithms for numerical quadrature, that is for the computation of definite integrals of functions in a closed and limited interval, also calculating the evaluation of the error committed in the computation of the integral itself;
- [differential_equations](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/differential_equations): More details below;
- [random_numbers_generator](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/random_numbers_generator): More details below;
- [computational_physics_whit_Monte_Carlo_methods](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/computational_physics_whit_Monte_Carlo_methods): In these exercises I use Monte Carlo techniques for the numerical simulation of physical experiments that can be performed in the laboratory.

**NOTE**: some programs require [Root](https://root.cern/install/) to run.

I report below the graphical results of some exercises.


## - [Random numbers generator](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/random_numbers_generator):
In these exercises an algorithm for the generation of random numbers is implemented. The algorithm is then used to produce a uniform, normal and exponential distribution ([EX.1](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/random_numbers_generator/Ex.1)). In the second exercise it is used to prove the central limit theorem ([EX.2](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/random_numbers_generator/Ex.2)). Finally, as a practical application of the algorithm, mono and multi-dimensional integrals are solved ([EX.3](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/random_numbers_generator/Ex.3)). You can find the distribution plots below:

## - [Differential equations](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/differential_equations):
In these exercises I use some methods for solving ordinary differential equations, in particular I use the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods

### Euler method for the harmonic oscillator ([EX.1](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/differential_equations/Ex.1)): 
- Euler's method is not very precise, in fact with a modest integration step we can see how it can be unstable, showing oscillations whose amplitude varies with time. The figure below shows the trend of x as a function of t with an integration step of 0.1 seconds:

- To have something even visually acceptable, you have to go in steps of at least 0.0001 s:
![hhhhhh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72387126/179501345-67ff3e88-76d5-47c0-812e-0a56b5356151.png)


- The following figure shows the accumulated error after 70 s of integration for different step values (Note how the slope of the curve is 1 in a log-log scale, showing how the error obtained is proportional to step h):

### Runge-Kutta method for the harmonic oscillator ([EX.2](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/differential_equations/Ex.2)):
- The fourth order Runge-Kutta method is much more precise than the Euler method, in fact, even with an integration step of 0.1 s it produces very stable oscillations:

- The following figure shows the accumulated error after 70 s of integration for different values of the step: ![xxxxxx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72387126/179502302-56ad8556-123f-4108-a574-4b013c63f23c.png)


### Runge-Kutta method for pendulum motion ([EX.3](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/differential_equations/Ex.3)):
- The pendulum equation is given by the relation  $d^2θ/dt^2 = -(g/l)sinθ$ where g=9.81 m/s is the acceleration of gravity on the earth's surface while l is the length of the pendulum. The figure illustrates the period as the amplitude varies for a pendulum with l = 1 m:

### Runge-Kutta method for the forced harmonic oscillator ([EX.4](https://github.com/gabevlogd/TNDS-exercises/tree/main/differential_equations/Ex.4)):
- The equation of the damped harmonic oscillator with forcing is given by the relation $d^2x/dt^2 = -ω_{0}^{2}x - α*dx/dt + sin(ω t)$. The following figures illustrate the initial part of the transient for initial conditions x(0) = 0, dx/dt(0) = 0 and different values of ω: (in order from first to third: ω = 5, 10, 15) ![5555555](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72387126/179512226-47db0d8f-74a2-4ddb-bfe9-629757864bce.png) ![101010](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72387126/179512837-a31258bb-65e1-41c0-8c84-266f640855c6.png) ![15151515](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72387126/179512873-c2daa87a-9d77-4b09-9a08-8db2cf37ed8f.png)

- The following figure illustrates the resonance curve. It shows the amplitude trend as a function of the pulsation of the external force. The resonance of the system is $ω_0=10rad/s$ in fact the maximum amplitude of oscillation is reached when the pulsation of the external force is $ω=10rad/s(=ω_0)$ ![σσσσσσσσσ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72387126/179517949-25c95a80-8274-499e-9569-f0e3f114ea36.png)

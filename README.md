# TNDS-exercises
some selected exercises carried out during the course of numerical treatment of experimental data (TNDS) at the physics faculty of Unimi

I report below some graphical results of the exercises


## - Differential equations:
In these exercises I use some methods for solving ordinary differential equations, in particular I use the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods
- ###### Euler method for the harmonic oscillator:
